	1.3 Development Frameworks:
            ASP .NET MVC- We picked this because it's easy to learn and we like the way it divides the logic from the view and the models also it is easy to integrate to a DBMS. Some of the team members already had worked with this framework. This framework also facilitates multiple people working on the same project.
           
            
           MS SQL Server- We picked this DBMS because some members had previous knowledge of it and we have access to a                 server that supports MS SQL. Also we want to make our application with high performance and scalability.In case of system failure Microsoft SQL Server has an automatic recovery mechanism that recovers a database to the last state of consistency in a matter of minutes, with no database administrator intervention. Critical applications can be up and running again right away. Also MS SQL has server based processing meaning that it reduces network traffic by processing database queries on the server before sending results to the client.
